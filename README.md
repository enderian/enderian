### Γειά! :wave:

(Hello!) Happy to see you here! Come, take a seat;

I'm **Spyros** (24) and my passion is building software. Bonus points if it helps improve people's lives!
I am currently working [@n26](https://github.com/n26) as a Backend Engineer in the Cards division.
Before this, I've been working at [@skroutz](https://github.com/skroutz), built on Ruby on Rails and React, building new ways for people to interact with our search engine and helping them in finding the products they need and want!

I've also been actively involved in authoring Minecraft server mods (which are written in either Java or Kotlin), both for my own community, [@vanillaverse](https://github.com/vanillaverse), as well as for other Minecraft servers since 2014.

In my off-time, you'll find me playing simulator games (Flight Simulator 2020 rocks! :airplane: ), scratching my electric guitar, or snapping some photos of the world. When that's not the case, I'll be having a beer at the local pub with a friend or two! :beers:

On my GitHub profile, you can find small examples of my work! Unfortunately, most of my work revolves around software that needs to be kept private, but I'm constantly trying to make as much of it available publicly.

Thank you for dropping by! :smile:
